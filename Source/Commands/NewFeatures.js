In [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), a memory leak may happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code. A memory leak has symptoms similar to a number of other problems and generally can only be diagnosed by a programmer with access to the program's source code.\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak)" },
